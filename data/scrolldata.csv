0,"On a bright June morning two figures--one a tall girl and the other
a child--could be seen climbing a narrow mountain path that winds up
from the pretty village of Mayenfeld, to the lofty heights of the Alm
mountain."
1,"In spite of the hot June sun the child was clothed as if to
keep off the bitterest frost."
2,"She did not look more than five years
old, but what her natural figure was like would be hard to say, for
she had on apparently two dresses, one above the other, and over these
a thick red woolen shawl. Her small feet were shod in thick, nailed
mountain-shoes."
3,"When the wayfarers came to the hamlet known as Doerfli, which is situated half-way up the mountain, they met with greetings from all sides, for the elder girl was now in her old home."
4,"As they were leaving the village, a voice called out: ""Wait a moment, Dete; if you are going on up the mountain, I will come along with you."""
5,"The girl thus addressed stood still, and the child immediately let go her hand and seated herself on the ground."
6,"Are you tired, Heidi? asked her companion. ""No, I am hot,"" answered the child. ""We shall soon get to the top now."
7,"You must walk bravely on a little longer, and take good, long steps, and in another hour we shall be there,"" said Dete."
8,"They were now joined by a stout, good-natured looking woman, who walked on ahead with her old acquaintance."
9,And where are you going with the child? asked the one who had just joined the party.
10,"I suppose it is the child your sister left? ""Yes,"" answered Dete. ""I am taking her up to Uncle, where she must stay."""
11,"This child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must be out of your senses, Dete! How can you think of such a thing! The old man, however, will soon send you both packing off home again!"
12,"He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather. He must do something for her.
I have had the charge of the child till now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place, for her sake."
