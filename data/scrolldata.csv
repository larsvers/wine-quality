1,"<p>But let's maybe have a look at what exactly we mean and why we think this is a good idea at all...</p>"
2,"<p>Assuming we have a bottle of wine, we can describe this wine in various ways.</p>"
3,"<p>We can give it a varietal, a vintage, maybe a name, which is how we would identify a wine in a conversation.</p><p>If you know your wines, you might be reasonably or indeed rather good in telling a wine's quality without even having to taste it.</p>"
4,"<p>However, a possibly more concise way to describe a wine might be to focus on the very liquid itself and decompose the wine into its physiochemical properties.</p><p>The main benefit of such a description is precision. Vintages, varietals and names are an approximate illustration of a wine summarising and representing information like soil, climate as well as production factors.<p></p>Physiochemical properties, in turn, are a concise characterisation of the very wine itself. The focus is on the liquid's composition rather than the wine's production context.</p><p>But how could this help us?</p>"
5,"<h1>A helping model</h1><p>Given a wine's physiochemical properties we could boldly assume they are associated to wine quality - meaning that a certain composition of these properties result in a good wine,<p>"
6,"<p>while a different set of properties fails to please distinguished palates entirely.</p>"
7,"<p>Naturally, we won’t rest before finding the golden formula.</p><p>If this was the case, we could express wine quality as a function entirely of its properties</p>."

9,"<p>We would have a model that would take a wine's properties as input</p>"
10,"<p>and would return some sort of estimate as to whether this wine is leaning towards being good or bad.</p><p>This model would not be able to tell every good wine from a bad wine. Reality is too complex, taste too subjective and - as a sense - not fully understood to capture such perfection mathematically. However, as we will see, a model can be accurate enough to support the oenologist's evaluations, improving the quality and speed of their decisions.</p><p>How would we go about this? Well, let’s maybe take a step back and consider what a model actually is.</p><p>In technical terms, a model reduces relationships between individual datapoints or variables to an equation.

11,"This child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must be out of your senses, Dete! How can you think of such a thing! The old man, however, will soon send you both packing off home again!"
12,"He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather. He must do something for her.
I have had the charge of the child till now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place, for her sake."
13,"To Frankfurt, where an extra good place awaits me, answered Dete. ""The people I am going to were down at the Baths last summer, and it was part of my duty to attend upon their rooms. They would have liked then to take me away with them, but I could not leave. Now they are there again and have repeated their offer, and I intend to go with them, you may make up your mind to that!"""
14,"I am glad I am not the child! exclaimed Barbel, with a gesture of horrified pity. ""Not a creature knows anything about the old man up there! He will have nothing to do with anybody, and never sets his foot inside a church from one year's end to another. When he does come down once in a while, everybody clears out of the way of him and his big stick. The mere sight of him, with his bushy grey eyebrows and his immense beard, is alarming enough. He looks like any old heathen or Indian, and few would care to meet him alone."""
15,"Well, and what of that? said Dete, in a defiant voice, ""he is the grandfather all the same, and must look after the child. He is not likely to do her any harm, and if he does, he will be answerable for it, not I."""
16,"I should very much like to know, continued Barbel, in an inquiring tone of voice, ""what the old man has on his conscience that he looks as he does, and lives up there on the mountain like a hermit, hardly ever allowing himself to be seen. All kinds of things are said about him. You, Dete, however, must certainly have learnt a good deal concerning him from your sister--am I not right?"""
17,"You are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
18,"Now Barbel had for long past been most anxious to ascertain particulars about Alm-Uncle, as she could not understand why he seemed to feel such hatred towards his fellow-creatures, and insisted on living all alone, or why people spoke about him half in whispers, as if afraid to say anything against him, and yet unwilling to take his Part. Moreover, Barbel was in ignorance as to why all the people in Dorfli called him Alm-Uncle, for he could not possibly be uncle to everybody living there. "
19,"As, however, it was the custom, she did like the rest and called the old man Uncle. Barbel had only lived in Dorfli since her marriage, which had taken place not long before. Previous to that her home had been below in Prattigau, so that she was not well acquainted with all the events that had ever taken place, and with all the people who had ever lived in Dorfli and its neighborhood. "
20,"Dete, on the contrary, had been born in Dorfli, and had lived there with her mother until the death of the latter the year before, and had then gone over to the Baths at Ragatz and taken service in the large hotel there as chambermaid. On the morning of this day she had come all the way from Ragatz with the child, a friend having given them a lift in a hay-cart as far as Mayenfeld. "
21,"Barbel was therefore determined not to lose this good opportunity of satisfying her curiosity. She put her arm through Dete's in a confidential sort of way, and said: ""I know I can find out the real truth from you, and the meaning of all these tales that are afloat about him. I believe you know the whole story. Now do just tell me what is wrong with the old man, and if he was always shunned as he is now, and was always such a misanthrope."""
22,"How can I possibly tell you whether he was always the same, seeing I am only six-and-twenty and he at least seventy years of age; so you can hardly expect me to know much about his youth. If I was sure, however, that what I tell you would not go the whole round of Prattigau, I could relate all kinds of things about him; my mother came from Domleschg, and so did he."
23,"Nonsense, Dete, what do you mean? replied Barbel, somewhat offended, ""gossip has not reached such a dreadful pitch in Prattigau as all that, and I am also quite capable of holding my tongue when it is necessary."""
24,"Very well then, I will tell you--but just wait a moment, said Dete in a warning voice, and she looked back to make sure that the child was not near enough to hear all she was going to relate; but the child was nowhere to be seen, and must have turned aside from following her companions some time before, while these were too eagerly occupied with their conversation to notice it. "
25,"Dete stood still and looked around her in all directions. The footpath wound a little here and there, but could nevertheless be seen along its whole length nearly to Dorfli; no one, however, was visible upon it at this moment."
26,"I see where she is, exclaimed Barbel, ""look over there!"" and she pointed to a spot far away from the footpath. ""She is climbing up the slope yonder with the goatherd and his goats. I wonder why he is so late to-day bringing them up. It happens well, however, for us, for he can now see after the child, and you can the better tell me your tale."""
27,"Oh, as to the looking after, remarked Dete, ""the boy need not put himself out about that; she is not by any means stupid for her five years, and knows how to use her eyes. She notices all that is going on, as I have often had occasion to remark, and this will stand her in good stead some day, for the old man has nothing beyond his two goats and his hut."""
28,Did he ever have more? asked Barbel.
29,"He? I should think so indeed, replied Dete with animation; ""he was owner once of one of the largest farms in Domleschg. He was the elder of two brothers; the younger was a quiet, orderly man, but nothing would please the other but to play the grand gentleman and go driving about the country and mixing with bad company, strangers that nobody knew. He drank and gambled away the whole of his property, and when this became known to his mother and father they died, one shortly after the other, of sorrow. The younger brother, who was also reduced to beggary, went off in his anger, no one knew whither, while Uncle himself, having nothing now left to him but his bad name, also disappeared. "
30,"For some time his whereabouts were unknown, then some one found out that he had gone to Naples as a soldier; after that nothing more was heard of him for twelve or fifteen years. At the end of that time he reappeared in Domleschg, bringing with him a young child, whom he tried to place with some of his kinspeople. Every door, however, was shut in his face, for no one wished to have any more to do with him. Embittered by this treatment, he vowed never to set foot in Domleschg again, and he then came to Dorfli, where he continued to live with his little boy. "
31,"His wife was probably a native of the Grisons, whom he had met down there, and who died soon after their marriage. He could not have been entirely without money, for he apprenticed his son, Tobias, to a carpenter. He was a steady lad, and kindly received by every one in Dorfli. The old man was, however, still looked upon with suspicion, and it was even rumoured that he had been forced to make his escape from Naples, or it might have gone badly with him, for that he had killed a man, not in fair fight, you understand, but in some brawl. "
32,"We, however, did not refuse to acknowledge our relationship with him, my great-grandmother on my mother's side having been sister to his grandmother. So we called him Uncle, and as through my father we are also related to nearly every family in Dorfli, he became known all over the place as Uncle, and since he went to live on the mountain side he has gone everywhere by the name of Alm-Uncle."""
33,"And what happened to Tobias? asked Barbel, who was listening with deep interest."
34,"Wait a moment, I am coming to that, but I cannot tell you everything at once, replied Dete. ""Tobias was taught his trade in Mels, and when he had served his apprenticeship he came back to Dorfli and married my sister Adelaide. They had always been fond of one another, and they got on very well together after they were married. But their happiness did not last long. "
35,"Her husband met with his death only two years after their marriage, a beam falling upon him as he was working, and killing him on the spot. They carried him home, and when Adelaide saw the poor disfigured body of her husband she was so overcome with horror and grief that she fell into a fever from which she never recovered. "
36,"On a bright June morning two figures--one a tall girl and the other
a child--could be seen climbing a narrow mountain path that winds up
from the pretty village of Mayenfeld, to the lofty heights of the Alm
mountain."
37,"In spite of the hot June sun the child was clothed as if to
keep off the bitterest frost."
38,"She did not look more than five years
old, but what her natural figure was like would be hard to say, for
she had on apparently two dresses, one above the other, and over these
a thick red woolen shawl. Her small feet were shod in thick, nailed
mountain-shoes."
39,"When the wayfarers came to the hamlet known as Doerfli, which is situated half-way up the mountain, they met with greetings from all sides, for the elder girl was now in her old home."
40,"As they were leaving the village, a voice called out: ""Wait a moment, Dete; if you are going on up the mountain, I will come along with you."""
41,"The girl thus addressed stood still, and the child immediately let go her hand and seated herself on the ground."
42,"Are you tired, Heidi? asked her companion. ""No, I am hot,"" answered the child. ""We shall soon get to the top now."
43,"You must walk bravely on a little longer, and take good, long steps, and in another hour we shall be there,"" said Dete."
44,"They were now joined by a stout, good-natured looking woman, who walked on ahead with her old acquaintance."
45,And where are you going with the child? asked the one who had just joined the party.
46,"I suppose it is the child your sister left? ""Yes,"" answered Dete. ""I am taking her up to Uncle, where she must stay."""
47,"This child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must be out of your senses, Dete! How can you think of such a thing! The old man, however, will soon send you both packing off home again!"
48,"He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather. He must do something for her.
I have had the charge of the child till now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place, for her sake."

53,"You are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
54,Oh yes..
55,"You are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
55,"He is right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
56,"She is right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
57,"I am right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
58,"We are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
59,"They are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
60,"It is right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
61,"Who is right? I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
62,"Why is he right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
63,"Where is right? I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
64,"What is right? I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
65,"yo? I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."
