    <h3>What next?</h3>

    <p>
      This little exploration was supposed to give you an idea of how machines can learn, enlighten and possibly help making and gauging wine. We predicted red wine quality using a dataset full of physiochemical properties of  Vinho Verde wines with a simple linear model. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As a next step it'd be interesting to swap out any or all of these components:
    </p>
    <p>
      What other <span class="highlight">outputs</span> would be helpful to predict or classify? Maybe a different quality definition or indeed a different outcome variable altogether like specific taste features, sales figures, or other measures of success or failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      What other <span class="highlight">data sources</span> do we have at hands? What metrics do we have in these datasets? Wineries might have structured data going back several years, logging physiochemical properties as well as information on varietal and growing conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And lastly, what <span class="highlight">model</span> might be most instructive to use? Will a simple linear model suffice to capture the associations? Do we need a non-linear model like for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine" target="_blank">Support Vector Machines</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" target="_blank">Neural Networks</a> &mdash; harder to reason about but possibly providing higher accuracy?
    </p>

      Let's see and take this as the beginning of a conversation...

      The dataset and a discussion around the original model built comes from the paper: <i>P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. <a href="https://scinapse.io/papers/2103459159" target="_blank">Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.</a> In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009</i>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this paper wasn't the only analytical adventure based on the data. The dataset aquired a life of its own thereafter, being adopted and embraced by the data science and machine learning community, so you can find a lot of analyses out there wrangling and modelling this very dataset.
