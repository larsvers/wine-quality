<h1>The data we have</h1>

<div class="section section-29">
  <p>
    If you are a winery (or at least work for one), you probably have such data specifically for all the past wines you produced, tasted and labelled. As such, you have a lot of data-encoded experience or &mdash; put differently &mdash; you are a great teacher. 
  </p>
  <p>
    You can do quite a lot with this information &mdash; more than this article will cover &mdash; but at least you could use this as your base data for classification.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-30">
  <p>
    If you do not have such data in your drawer, there's a rather <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality">well equipped and tested dataset</a> available for our purposes showing a total of 1,600 wines,
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-31">
  <p>
    each row representing a different wine, showing the wine's properties
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-32">
  <p>
    as well as their <i>Quality</i> rating.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each rating is based on at least three evaluations from wine experts ranging from 0 (ü§Æ) to 10 (üèÜ). We‚Äôll simplify this later to a binary outcome &mdash; just <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> &mdash; but for now, this is what we have.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-33">
  <p>
    The other eleven variables in here are the physiochemical properties, our model shall learn to associate with quality:
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-34">
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Acidity values</span> can have a set of impacts on taste. They can impart sourness or tartness &mdash; if levels are too high they can tip things to a more vinegary taste &mdash;
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-35">
  <p>
    and they can add freshness to your wine.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-36">
  <p>
    The dataset also sports the amount of <span class="highlight">sugar</span> remaining after fermentation,
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-37">
  <p>
    as well as the amount of <span class="highlight">salt</span>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-38">
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Sulfur dioxide</span> indirectly affects taste by preventing microbial growth and wine oxidation which can spoil aromas.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-39">
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Wine density</span> is closely linked to alcohol and sugar content,
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-40">
  <p>
    while <span class="highlight">pH</span> values describe how acidic or basic a wine is.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-41">
  <p>
    Added <span class="highlight">sulphates</span> can promote the degree of sulfur dioxide in the wine, which &mdash; as mentioned &mdash; act as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-42">
  <p>
    And lastly there is <span class="highlight">Alcohol</span>, which probably doesn‚Äôt need much of an introduction.

    All these wines in our training dataset are red wines from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinho_Verde">Vinho Verde</a> region in the north west of Portugal. Each wine was sampled and evaluated between 2004 and 2007 but this data has since been used in many studies and papers to understand the connection between wine properties and quality. There‚Äôs also a publicly available training set of <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality">white wines</a>, but this red wine dataset will do just fine for our example‚Ä¶
