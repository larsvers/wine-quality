<h1>The data we have</h1>

<div class="section section-29">
  <p>
    If you are a vinery, you probably have that specifically for all the past wines you produced, tasted and labelled. And you can do quite a lot with this information (more than this article will cover).

<div class="section section-30">
  <p>
    If not, there's a rather well equipped and tested dataset available for our purposes showing a total of 1600 wines,
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-31">
  <p>
    Each wine occupying a row in the data, showing their properties
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-32">
  <p>
    as well as their quality rating.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each rating is based on at least three evaluations from wine experts rating from 0 (bad) to 10 (good). We’ll simplify this later to a binary outcome - good or bad - but for now, this is what we have.

<div class="section section-33">
  <p>
    The other 11 variables we have are our physiochemical properties, our model shall learn to stand on:
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-34">
  <p>
    Acidity values imparting sourness, tartness and, if levels are too high, the dangers of a vinegary taste
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-35">
  <p>
    as well as adding 'freshness'.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-36">
  <p>
    The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-37">
  <p>
    the amount of salt in the wine
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-38">
  <p>
    Sulfur dioxides preventing microbial growth and wine oxidation
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-39">
  <p>
    the wine density - closely linked to alcohol and sugar content
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-40">
  <p>
    pH values describing how acidic or basic a wine is
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-41">
  <p>
    Sulphates which act as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-42">
  <p>
    and lastly alcohol which probably doesn’t need much of an introduction
  </p>

    Now, all these wines are red wines from the Vinho Verde region in the north west of Portugal where they have been sampled and evaluated between 2004 and 2007. There’s an even larger publicly avaiailable dataset of white wines, but then this will do for our example…

    Before we build our model, what does this data look like?
