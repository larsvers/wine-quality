<h1>The data we have</h1>

<div class="section section-29">
  <p>
    If you are a winery (or at least work for one), you might have datasets for all your past wines you produced, tasted and labelled. As such, you have valuable data-encoded experience you could use as base data for classification.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-30">
  <p>
    We don't have that at hands here, but there's a rather <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality" target="_blank">well equipped and tested dataset</a> available for our purposes showing a total of 1,600 wines from Portugal,
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-31">
  <p>
    each row representing a different wine, showing the wine's properties
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-32">
  <p>
    as well as their <i>Quality</i> rating.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each rating is based on at least three evaluations from wine experts ranging from 0 (ü•Ä) to 10 (üèÜ). We‚Äôll simplify this later to a binary outcome &mdash; just <span class="good">high</span> or <span class="bad">low quality</span> &mdash; but for now, this is what we have.

  <p>
    The other eleven variables in here are the physiochemical properties, our model shall learn to associate with quality:
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-33 section-34 section-35">
  <p>
    A set of components describing the acidity of the wine,
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-36 section-37">
  <p>
   Sugar and salts (chlorides),
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-38">
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Sulfur dioxide</span>, preventing off-odours from oxidation and inhibiting unwanted bacteria.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-39 section section-40">
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Density</span> and the wine's <span class="highlight">pH value</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-41">
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Potassim Sulphate</span> which is likely used to detect the levels of Calcium Sulphate for both clarification and to lower the pH value
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-42">
  <p>
    and lastly there is <span class="highlight">Alcohol</span>, which probably doesn‚Äôt need an introduction.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-43">
  <p>
    All these wines are red wines from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinho_Verde" target="_blank">Vinho Verde</a> region in the north west of Portugal. Each wine was sampled, and quality assessed between 2004 and 2007 by the <span class="highlight">Viticulture Commission of the Vinho Verde Region</span>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Commission is concerned with improving and safeguarding the quality of regional wines by <a href="https://portal.vinhoverde.pt/pt/estatisticas" target="_blank">certifying</a> the wine's origin and making sure the wine's components lie within <a href="https://portal.vinhoverde.pt/pt/produtos-regras-de-conformidade/GVT" target="_blank">legislated value ranges</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As such, <span class="highlight">"quality"</span> is indeed defined as a measure of taste but strictly limited to Vinho Verde wines of a specific period. Wherever we take this model and whatever other wine's we might test with it, we should be aware of this context. Any model built on this data won't generalise to every wine under the sun.

    Ok. We have some data, but we don't know much about it yet. A good start to any type of data analysis is to profile the base data &mdash;¬†getting a sense of the measures' shape and correlations. Let's do this now...
