<h1>Learning by example</h1>

<div class="section section-12">
  <p>
    This is where we need to take our model into our hands and teach it like a child. We want it to learn how to tell a good wine from a bad wine – how to predict, in this case <strong>classify</strong> each wine. But we can’t be there for it in the future, tasting each wine and tell it what is good or bad. It needs to stand on its own data columns. This process is called <strong>supervised learning</strong> and we all know its powers from our own childhood.

<div class="section section-13">
  <p>
    Think back to the days when you learned your animal names. 
  </p>
  <p>
    You were probably just sitting in a proudly self-concocted puddle of peas, mash and apple juice leafing through a picture book of animal drawings, while your father tried to teach you what a sloth looks like.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-14">
  <p>
    Any of these shapes could be a sloth,
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-15">
  <p>
    but your father calmly supervised your learning,
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-16">
  <p>
    by labelling the non-sloths
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-17">
  <p>
    and celebrating the actual sloths!
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-18">
  <p>
    And even though not every sloth looks the same,
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-19">
  <p>
    after many examples, you learned the basic features that made up a sloth. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-20">
  <p>
    And although you might sometimes be unsure whether the thing you looked at, the concoction of lines and shapes was a sloth indeed – possibly because the picture book was a bit rubbish - you learned to give it a good guess at least – maybe basing your decision on some sloth probability you dared.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-21">
  <p>
    So &mdash; turning our sloth back into a bottle of wine
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-22">
  <p>
    it turns out that if you want your model to differentiate between
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-23">
  <p>
    a high quality
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-24">
  <p>
    and a low quality wine, a single specimen won’t be enough.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-25">
  <p>
    Just like a single animal drawing won't teach your child what a sloth is, you need as many wines as you can get hold of.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-26">
  <p>
    {{! empty }}
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-27">
  <p>
    Each wine labelled as either good or bad.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section section-28">
  <p>
    In a next step you can split these wines into their respective quality group and identify how their features differ for each group. How, for example, good wines tend to have a higher alcohol level than bad wines. Or how lower amounts of chlorides seem to increase the quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, what we need, in short, is a large dataset with labelled data.
