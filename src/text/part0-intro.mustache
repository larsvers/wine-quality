    Wine has been with us for quite some time. We started yeast fermentation in the stone age, made the first dedicated wine jars some 7,000 years ago and marvelled at Tutankhamun taking <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/king-tut-drank-red-wine-r/" target="_blank">26 jars of wine to his grave</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A few things have changed on the way, though. Grapes aren't feet stomped anymore, barrels replaced beeswaxed terracotta for storage and neither seawater nor honey are used to improve the wine palate anymore.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's a lot more known about wine and how to make it these days. Winemakers have more controlled facilities and while tasting still plays a central role, their decisions also rely on analytical tools that help guide the winemaking process these days.

  <p>    
    Given this long shift to a more analytical, data-supported way of winemaking, can we maybe isolate measurable properties that help predict something useful about a wine?
  </p>
  <p>
    This article tries to explain how such a prediction could work.
  </p>
  <p>
    We first look at what a predictive model is and how it would operate in broad conceptual terms, before building a simple model with a publicly available dataset containing physiochemical properties as inputs and wine quality as the output.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, we build a little prediction machine, you can play with...
