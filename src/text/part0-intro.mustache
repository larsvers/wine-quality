    For the better or worse, wine has been with us for quite some time. We started yeast fermentation in the stone age, made the first dedicated wine jars some 7,000 years ago and marvelled at King Tutankhamun who took 26 jars of wine to his grave.

    While we didn’t lose the dedication or interest, a few things changed since then. We rarely stomp the grapes with our feet, we use barrels rather than beeswax lined terracotta for storage and we gave up mixing wine with seawater and honey to improve its palate.

    Yet, one key question is still of crucial importance: what makes a wine a good wine? The Roman would have had an ideal amount of saltwater and maybe even a special type of honey to make it perfect. Today, the winemaker's concern with honey is likely to be limited to her breakfast habits. However, he'll still try to manipulate a wine’s quality by controlling the wine’s very properties &mdash; sugar, sulfates, alcohol and others.

    This piece wonders if we can use these properties to predict a wine's quality...
