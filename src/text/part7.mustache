    These are the basics. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For our full model we draw a curve not only for one but for eleven predictors, which is pretty impossible to display visually as you can imagine. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We’re also skipping the details here on how to find this best curve. We do this with an optimisation process that finds the curve closest to the data. For logistic regression we would typically use an optimisation process called <strong>maximum likelihood</strong>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, we would always check the accuracy of the model, by testing it on unseen data. This very logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of <strong>79%</strong>, meaning 79% of all cases got predicted correctly.

    Spending more time on model selection and engineering <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2019aut/data/assignment_308875_raw/25892857.pdf">can in fact get this up to 95%</a></p>.

    You also get different things from different models.

    For example, a model from the Random Forest family will enlighten you with a neat ranking of which variables are most important in our predictions.

    In this case, alcohol appears to have the biggest impact on quality, followed by volatile acidity (no vinegar please) and the amount of sulphates acting as antimicrobial and antioxidant. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Used together, a model and variable importance can flag the current state of the wine quality as well as potentially providing informed ideas as to whether, where and what changes might help improve the overall wine quality during the process of wine making. Each predictor, each variable in your data can be considered a model screw you can adjust to achieve the highest quality wine.
